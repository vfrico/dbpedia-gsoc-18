# Google Summer of Code @ DBpedia

This is the central repository for all the resources generated by my work
on DBpedia throughout the Google Summer of Code 2018.

The branch `gh-pages` contains the sources of the blog.

On the `scripts` folder, you can find several scripts to generate training datasets and other useful stuff
